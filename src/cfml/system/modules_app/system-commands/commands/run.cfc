/**
 * Execute an operating system level command in the native shell.  The binary must be in the PATH, or you can specify the full
 * path to it.  This command will wait for the OS exectuable to complete but will flush the output as it is received.
 * .
 * {code:bash}
 * run myApp.exe
 * run /path/to/myApp
 * {code}
 * .
 * A shortcut for running OS binaries is to prefix the binary with "!".  In this mode, any other params need to be positional.
 * There is no CommandBox parsing applied to the command's arguments.  They are passed straight to the native shell.
 * .
 * {code:bash}
 * !myApp.exe
 * !/path/to/myApp
 * !dir
 * !npm ll
 * !ipconfig
 * !ping google.com -c 4
 * {code}
 * .
 * Executing Java would look like this
 * .
 * {code:bash}
 * !java -version
 * !java -jar myLib.jar
 * {code}
 * .
 * You can even call other CLIs
 * .
 * {code:bash}
 * !git init
 * touch index.cfm
 * !git add .
 * !git commit -m "Initial Commit"
 * {code}
 *
